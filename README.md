# Tires SOS Rescue — website

Next.js (App Router) marketing site for Tires SOS Rescue, a tire & auto shop
in San José, CA (tires, brakes, oil changes, batteries, rims, alignment).

**Stack:** Next.js 14 · React · plain CSS · Vercel (hosting). No database,
no backend — the shop runs on walk-ins and phone calls, not online booking.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev   # http://localhost:3000
```

## Edit site content in ONE place

Open **`app/site.config.js`**:

- `SITE` — name, phone, address, map links, hours (per weekday, used to
  compute the live "Open now / Closed" badge), social links
- `SERVICES` — the service cards shown in the "What We Do" section
- `TESTIMONIALS` — the review quotes shown in "What Customers Say"
- `COPY` — every other bilingual (English/Spanish) UI string

Every text field that needs both languages is a `{ en: "...", es: "..." }`
object — the site's language toggle reads whichever one is active.

## Design system

Brand colors are the shop's real ones — **orange & black** (`--color-accent:
#ff6b1a` in `app/globals.css`). Headings use Archivo Black, body uses Inter,
both self-hosted at build time via `next/font` (no runtime font requests).
All scroll/hover animations are pure CSS + a small IntersectionObserver
`Reveal` component (`app/components/Reveal.js`) and are fully disabled for
users with `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Photos

**Owner's BMW M3 Competition** — the "Owner's Ride" section
(`app/components/OwnersRide.js`) ships with a styled placeholder. To show the
real car: drop the photo into `/public/owners-m3.jpg`, then replace the
placeholder `<div>` with the `<img>` tag shown in the comment right above it
(a one-line swap).

**Gallery** — the gallery section currently uses placeholder tiles
(`app/components/Gallery.js`) since Instagram photos can't be pulled in
automatically. Drop real shop/vehicle photos into `/public`, then swap the
placeholder tiles for `<img>` tags pointing at them.
